# Performance now

## pacman rule

hier gelde de pacman regel op de conventies.
altijd tijden het praten in groepen ruimte over laten


## Tammy everts - how fast is fast enough

- fast is magical (catherine Jue, co founder at kernal)

-fast is pragmatic - fast enough to improvw buainess metrics
if there is no ROI, there is no point in making it faster

pragmagical?

the space between pragmatix and magical, as small as possible

## who are you trying to please

make your boss happy, make google happy, your users etc.

### Your boss

people believe that if the company is good enough, peopel dont care about the speed

- slow site = fewer convertions
when the speed ia normal now, the people who had slow theottle of the experiment still had low return rate

performance plateau starts at 2.8s lcp. that is the threshold

### Google

they reccomend to have good core web vitals for searxh

CWV is a starting point, not a finish line

google thresholds is not your business threshold

200ms is good interaction next paint for google

aiming for someone elses metrics is not working

### Your users

metrics do not equal feeling when regarding page speed


kara pernice~ ppl spending a long time on the sote clicking a lot of ljnka visitinf many pages means 
either they are engaged or lost

a usablity test and site analytics pairing for good research

## engagement tasks and prductivity tasks

engagement task:
open ended-absorbing
high tolerance for waiting
like booming a holiday

productivity tasks
frame of mind is different
no tolerance for waiting

so same users, same clicks but different experience

sander van surkum - one alow step can make whole journey feel slow

pagmatic is what your site needs
magical - 100ms

so,

know who to pelase
know why usrrs on ur aitw (engagement or productive)
